stackfull/scope
===============

Multi-platform, multi-purpose test and measurement utilities.

## Goal

Create a suite of measurement tools for space-limited workshops that don't have
space for full-size scopes and logic analysers.

## History

This project pulls together some earlier open-source tools from other people:


#### Girino

A fast ISR driven scope for the Arduino Uno by Cristiano Lino Fontana.

 * Code: https://github.com/supacyan/girino
 * Tutorial: http://www.instructables.com/id/Girino-Fast-Arduino-Oscilloscope/
 
This project had more flexible hardware based triggering than I needed but had
a neat little circular buffer sweep and delay mechanism. The github repo formed
the basis of the stackfull/scope project.


## Build

Uses platformio for now.
